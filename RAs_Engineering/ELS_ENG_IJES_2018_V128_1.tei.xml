			<abstract>
				<p>This paper aims at modelling stress-affected chemical reactions in spherical particles by adopting the chemo-mechanical framework based on the chemical affinity tensor and combining it with the finite-strain non-linear viscoelastic constitutive model. The model is applied to the chemical reaction between lithium (Li) ions and silicon (Si), which has been considered as promising successor to graphite for use as active material in lithium-ion battery (LIB) anodes. However, during charging of LIBs, Si enters into the chemical reaction with Li ions, causing large volumetric expansion of Si particles, which leads to the emergence of mechanical stresses, which, in turn, can affect the kinetics of the chemical reaction even up to the reaction arrest. In this paper, the propagation of the reaction front separating the chemically transformed and the untransformed phases is modelled, and the coupled stress-diffusion-reaction problem is solved using the finite element approach. The model predicts the retardation and the locking of the chemical reaction in Si depending on the values of the chemical energy parameter, which corresponds to experimental observations.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>In recent years, special attention has been paid to the enhancement of the capacity of lithium-ion batteries by investigating the applicability of various active materials, such as silicon, that can accommodate larger amount of lithium atoms than commonly used graphite. The main challenge for the application of Si as a novel anode active material is its large volumetric expansion of up to 300% in the charged state <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">( McDowell, Lee, Nix, &amp; Cui, 2013 )</ref>, which leads to the emergence of the mechanical stress and the degradation/failure of the anode during charge/discharge cycling. Various Si nano-structures such as nanowires, spherical particles embedded into a graphite matrix, porous Si-C composites and special coatings applied to Si particles have been proposed to solve this problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">( Lukatskaya, Dunn, &amp; Gogotsi, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Luo, Wu, Luo, Huang, &amp; Dravid, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Magasinski et al., 2010 )</ref>. However, at the moment, there are no straightforward solutions to this problem and deeper understanding of the chemical reaction with Li ions and interaction of Si particles with the surrounding material is required.</p><p>From the physical point of view, there is a difference between the mechanism of reaction between Li and graphite and between Li and Si -in the case of graphite, the mechanism is based on the intercalation into the host lattice, while in the case of Si, it is the formation of new chemical compounds <ref type="bibr">("alloying")</ref>  . Thus, the reaction between Li ions and Si can be understood as a chemical transformation. Term "lithiation" of a material is often used in literature to refer to the chemical reaction of the material with Li ions. Therefore, in this paper, the reaction between Li ions and Si is also referred to as the lithiation of Si.</p><p>During the initial lithiation (i.e. upon the first cycle) of either crystalline or amorphous Si nano-particles, the existence if two distinct phases, the untransformed and the transformed Si, is observed, while the chemical reaction is localised at the reaction front of nanometre thickness that separates unlithiated and lithiated Si <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">( Cubuk &amp; Kaxiras, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">van Havenbergh, Turner, Marx, &amp; van Tendeloo, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Jia &amp; Li, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">McDowell, Lee, Harris et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">McDowell et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Yang et al., 2012 )</ref>. This process is referred to as "the two-phase lithiation" in literature. It should be also mentioned that a process, with a smooth change of Li concentration within Si particle (i.e. without a reaction front), was observed upon the subsequent lithiation-delithiation cycles <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">( McDowell, Lee, Harris et al., 2013 )</ref>, which was referred to as "one-phase lithiation". In the case the two-phase process, the lithiation rate is limited by the rate of the chemical reaction taking place at the reaction front. Two modelling concepts of the reaction localisation exist. One type of models deals with a smooth spatial distribution of the lithium concentration and a transition layer with a rapidly changing concentration that connects concentration-poor and concentration-rich phases. For example, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chen et al. (2014)</ref> , a phase-field model was proposed and applied to the case of a single spherical Si particle, and lithiation-induced stresses were analysed. Another type of models considers a chemical reaction front as a sharp interface, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Cui, Gao, and Qu (2013)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Jia and Li (2015)</ref> . In the present paper a sharp reaction front is considered.</p><p>The volumetric expansion of Si particles during lithiation leads to mechanical stresses, which influence the kinetics of the reaction between Si and Li. Therefore, from the mechanical perspective, there has been an extensive research focus on modelling of stresses produced by the lithiation, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Dimitrijevic, Aifantis, and Hackl (2012)</ref> . But the influence of stresses on the lithiation kinetics still remains unclear and must be captured to model the battery charging process accurately. Since Li is delivered to the reaction front by diffusion, stresses may affect the lithiation process via the diffusion flux rate and via the lithiation reaction rate. It should be noted that coupling of stresses, diffusion and chemical reaction has been also intensively discussed in the context of Si oxidation, which is a transformation process of a solid body that is similar to lithiation. In a number of papers, the well-known Deal-Grove model of oxidation <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">( Deal &amp; Grove, 1965 )</ref> has been modified by considering the classical diffusion equation with the stress-dependent diffusion coefficient and the stress-dependent reaction rate parameter. The choice of stress characteristics (the first invariant, the normal stresses, or the intensity of shear stresses), which affect the reaction and the diffusion parameters, was made intuitively by using the notion of the activation volume, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Kao, McVittie, Nix, and Saraswat (1988)</ref> , <ref type="bibr">Sutardja and Oldham (1989)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Rafferty (1990)</ref> . Additionally, a concentration-dependent volumetric expansion was introduced, which led to the total stress-diffusion coupling, e.g. <ref type="bibr">Rao and</ref> Hughes (20 0 0) and <ref type="bibr">Rao,</ref><ref type="bibr">Hughes,</ref><ref type="bibr">and Garikipati (20 0 0)</ref> . A reaction-controlled diffusion model for the lithiation process of a spherical Si particle, in which the reaction front kinetics was modelled as a pressure-dependent process, was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Zhang, Lee, Lee, Cui, and Linder (2015)</ref> . The influence of stresses on diffusion via additional terms in the diffusion equation in various chemo-mechanical processes has been also considered, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Knyazeva (2003)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Toribio, Kharin, Lorenzo, and Vergara (2011)</ref> .</p><p>Another group of models includes the influence of stresses on the diffusion flux and the chemical reaction rate via a scalar chemical potential, which depends on the concentration and the stresses, and gradient of which governs the flux of the reactant, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Loeffel and Anand (2011)</ref> , <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bower and Guduru (2012)</ref> ; <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bower, Guduru, and Sethuraman (2011)</ref> , <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Cui, Gao, and Qu (2012)</ref> , <ref type="bibr">Suo (2012, 2013)</ref> , <ref type="bibr">Attariani (2013, 2014)</ref> , <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bower, Guduru, and Chason (2015)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Dal and Miehe (2015)</ref> . For example, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Dal and Miehe (2015)</ref> , a stress-diffusion model was presented, in which the isotropic volumetric expansion depends linearly on the concentration of Li, while the diffusion is driven by the spatial gradient of the chemical potential, which is the function of the concentration and the pressure. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Cui et al. (2013)</ref> , previously developed stress-diffusion model, in which a stress-dependent chemical potential was proposed and applied to the problem of lithiation of a spherical Si particle , was extended to the problem with a chemical reaction as a kinetics governing process. It should also be mentioned that the velocity of the reaction front can be controlled by the reaction rate at the reaction front rather than by the diffusivity of the reactant (see e.g. Jia &amp; Li, 2015 and reference therein), which is Li ions in the case of lithiation.</p><p>The coupled stress-diffusion-reaction models were also extended to describe additional physical effects, such as damage of Si particles upon lithiation. For example, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Zhang, Krischok, and Linder (2016)</ref> , the approach of <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Zhang et al. (2015)</ref> was extended and the effective damage field was introduced. In <ref type="bibr">Klinsmann, Rosato, Kamlah, and McMeeking (2016a,b)</ref> , a coupled stress-diffusion model was used to study a crack growth during the lithiation process.</p><p>In the present paper, the thermodynamically consistent approach to mechanochemistry of reaction fronts based on the notion of the chemical potential is further developed. In the last decades of the twentieth century it became clear that chemical potentials are tensorial quantities in the case of solid phase transformations, which are related to the Eshelby energy-momentum tensors (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Grinfeld, 1991 and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Abeyaratne &amp;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Knowles, 2006 and</ref><ref type="bibr">references therein)</ref>. This can be explained by the fact that the phase equilibrium takes place at a surface element oriented with respect to the axis of the stress tensor. The tensorial nature of the chemical potential, in turn, leads to the tensorial nature of the chemical affinity, for which chemical reactions are to be considered at an oriented element of a surface that passes through a point, as opposed to a reaction just at a point. The tensorial nature of the chemical affinity was also pointed out in <ref type="bibr">Rusanov (20 05,</ref><ref type="bibr">20 06)</ref> . The detailed derivation of the expression of the chemical affinity tensor in the case of large deformations, made for materials of arbitrary rheology with the use of the mass, the linear momentum, and the energy balance equations and the entropy inequality, can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Freidin (2015)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Freidin, Vilchevskaya, and Korolev (2014)</ref> .</p><p>Up to now, the approach based on the chemical affinity tensor was applied to a number of boundary value problems for elastic solids undergoing chemical reactions only in the case of infinitesimally small strains <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">( Freidin, Korolev, Aleshchenko, &amp; Vilchevskaya, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Freidin, Morozov, Petrenko, &amp; Vilchevskaya, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Freidin et al., 2014 )</ref>. However, modelling of problems such as lithiation of Si particles requires capturing large non-linear viscoelastic deformations. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to study the kinetics of the reaction front governed by the chemical affinity tensor in the case of large deformations and non-linear viscoelastic constitutive material model of the reaction product and to apply the proposed model for the simulation of the stress-affected kinetics of the two-phase lithiation of spherical Si particles.</p><p>The paper is organised as follows: a brief summary of the framework and the concept of chemical affinity tensor is given first in Section 2 , along with the formulation of a general quasi-static problem involving the mechanical, the diffusion, and the chemical reaction parts. This is followed by the problem formulation for the case of the two-phase lithiation in Si particles in the framework of finite elastic and non-linear viscoelastic deformations and also by some details of the finite element solution process ( Section 3 ). Results of finite element simulations are discussed in Section 4 .</p></div>

Operator ‚àá is defined with respect to the current configuration; however, when Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_17">19</ref>is solved numerically, it is rewritten with respect to the reference configuration. The constitutive relations can be arbitrary. In this paper, the non-linear viscoelastic material behaviour is considered ( Section 3.2 ). The reaction front moves due to the consumption of the reactant B * , which diffuses through the transformed material B + from the outer surface of œÖ + to the reaction front. In the case of finite strains, it is convenient to project the diffusion flux onto the reference configuration of one of the solid constituents, i.e. to consider the Lagrangian diffusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">( Freidin, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Wilmanski, 1998 )</ref>. In this paper, the diffusion is projected onto the reference configuration of material B ‚àí . It is assumed that the diffusion process happens on a much faster time scale than the chemical reaction. This assumption is also motivated by the choice of the parameters that are used in the calculations, as discussed at the end of Section 3.5 .

Operators ‚àá 0 and 0 are defined with respect to the reference configuration of B ‚àí . When A NN = 0 , the chemical equilibrium takes place and, thus, the reaction front does not move.

If the front has a simple geometry (e.g. flat or spherical front) and can be described by a number of geometrical parameters, the equations can be solved independently, thus, the problem can be solved step by step. First, stresses and strains are to be found from the equilibrium Eq. (19) as the functions of the geometrical parameters, which characterise the front position. Then, stresses and strains are to be substituted into the expression for A NN . Afterwards, Eq. <ref type="formula">23</ref>is to be solved for c eq , and the dependence of c eq on the geometrical parameters of the front position is to be found. Then, the current concentration at the reaction front is to be found from the diffusion problem with boundary condition (26) or (28) as the function of the geometrical parameters of the reaction front. When both concentrations are found, the kinetic equation takes a form of a differential equation that relates the time derivatives of the front geometrical parameters and the parameters themselves. Integration of the equation gives the time evolution of the front. Such step-by-step solution was realised analytically for simple problems in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Freidin, Morozov et al. (2016)</ref> ; <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Freidin et al. (2014)</ref> .</p><p>In the case of a viscoelastic constituents, stresses and strains depend not only on the position of the front but also on time through the history of the front propagation. The problem of finding the stress-strain state and the front velocity cannot be split even in simple cases, as it can be done in the case of elasticity. The reason for this is that in the case of viscoelasticity, the constitutive equations contain internal variables, such as the viscous deformation, which are determined by a time-dependent differential equation. Since the current concentration, c , is found from the diffusion equation with the boundary condition on the moving reaction front, the spatial distribution of the concentration also depends on the history of the process. Thus, to describe the front propagation, the coupled stress-diffusion-reaction problem has to be solved.</p></div>

Since, in many cases, amorphous Si (a-Si) is used as the active material in battery electrodes <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">( McDowell, Lee, Harris et al., 2013 )</ref>, the present paper is focused on the case of a-Si, 2 which transforms into a-Li 3.75 Si.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Constitutive behaviour of the material</head><p>Two constitutive models have to be specified -the models for the behaviour of the transformed and the untransformed materials.</p><p>The spherical core of the particle consists of the untransformed material, B ‚àí , and is subjected to a volumetric deformation. It is modelled as a non-linear elastic material under the deformation gradient F ‚àí , which is isotropic, i.e.</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">F ‚àí = ( J ‚àí ) 1 / 3 I ,</formula><p>where J ‚àí = det F ‚àí . The following form of the strain energy density for this material is assumed:</p><formula xml:id="formula_29">W ‚àí = K ‚àí ( J ‚àí ‚àí 1 ‚àí ln J ‚àí ) ,<label>(30)</label></formula><p>where K ‚àí is the bulk modulus.

Within the adopted framework, a solid skeleton assumption is made for the diffusion -the diffusion of B * through B + does not lead to any additional deformations of B + . This allows focusing on stresses produced by the chemical reaction only, since the chemical reaction becomes the only source of the deformation. It should be noted that since the derivation of the chemical affinity tensor does not rely on the form of the constitutive laws, it is possible to introduce additional concentration-dependent deformation gradient (similar to temperature-dependent thermal expansion deformation gradient) into the multiplicative decomposition of the total deformation gradient. This will allow to take into account the volume change associated with the diffusing Li atoms.</p><p>For the formulation of the constitutive equations of the transformed material B + , it is natural to start with the stress-free configuration. Thus, deformation gradient F + , which characterises the deformation with respect to the reference (stress-free) configuration of B + , is introduced. In addition to this, deformation gradient F 0 + is defined with respect to the stress-free configuration of B ‚àí , as was introduced in Eq. (16) . The constitutive model is similar to the standard linear solid model. However, the compressible neo-Hookean springs are used instead of the linear springs and the non-linear stress-dependent viscosity is used instead of the linear viscosity <ref type="figure">( Fig. 2 a)</ref>. The spring with the deformation gradient F e is connected sequentially with the dashpot, which represents the deformation gradient F p .</p><p>The dependence of the viscosity on the stress is chosen such that the material demonstrates the behaviour that is very similar to the elasto-plastic behaviour (as illustrated in stress-strain diagrams in <ref type="figure">Fig. 2 b)</ref>. This motivates notation F p with subscript "p", which is usually used for plastic deformations, and F p is further referred to as the plastic deformation gradient. The reason for adopting such model is twofold. First of all, such viscoelastic framework with highly non-linear viscosity (according to the power law or the Eyring-like relation) is one of the standard ways of modelling many materials, from metals (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Maresca, Kouznetsova, &amp; Geers, 2016 )</ref> to polymers (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Klompen, Engels, Govaert, &amp; Meijer, 2005 )</ref>, and allows describing both short-term and long-term (i.e. creep or relaxation) behaviour. Secondly, when such a model is used for lithiated Si, the available experimental data for this material allows estimating the viscosity parameter directly (see the end of the subsection and Section 3.5 ).</p><p>A parallel spring represents the deformation gradient F + such that</p><formula xml:id="formula_32">F + = F e ‚Ä¢ F p .<label>(33)</label></formula><p>Isochoric Finger tensors B e and B + are then given by B e = ( J e ) ‚àí 2 <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>. The schematic representation of the constitutive material model (a), and the stress-strain behaviour of the model that is used for the transformed material (lithiated Si) under uniaxial tension at various true strain rates, under uniaxial repeated loading, and under uniaxial cyclic deformation (b).

The strain energy density of the material B + is defined as 3 :</p><formula xml:id="formula_34">W + = W s + W h , W s = K + ( J e ‚àí 1 ‚àí ln J e ) + G s 2 tr B e ‚àí 3 , W h = G h 2 tr B + ‚àí 3 ,<label>(36)</label></formula><p>where K + is the bulk modulus, G h is the hardening modulus, and the total shear modulus of material B + is G + = G s + G h . In Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_34">36</ref>, the strain energy density W + is divided into two parts, W s and W h , which correspond to strain energy densities of two different springs in the rheological model. The Kirchhoff stress tensor is derived from the expression for the strain energy density <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">( Geers, 2004 )</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_35">œÑ + = ‚àÇW + ‚àÇ F e ‚Ä¢ F e T .<label>(37)</label></formula><p>where W + depends on F e through both B e and B + , while the dependence of B + on F e at given F p follows from (35) and (33) .

(36) and (37) lead to the expression for the Cauchy stress tensor, which is split into the hydrostatic stress, œÉ v , the deviatoric stress that is driving the plastic deformation, œÉ d s , and the deviatoric stress that governs the hardening behaviour,</p><formula xml:id="formula_37">œÉ d h : œÉ + = 1 J e œÑ + = œÉ v + œÉ d s + œÉ d h ,<label>(39)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_38">œÉ v = K + 1 ‚àí 1 J e I ,<label>(40)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_39">œÉ d s = G s 1 J e B d e , B d e = B e ‚àí 1 3 tr B e I ,<label>(41)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_40">œÉ d h = G h 1 J e B d + , B d + = B + ‚àí 1 3 tr B + I .<label>(42)</label></formula><p>3 Various strain energy densities for the compressible neo-Hookean material exist <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">( Horgan &amp; Saccomandi, 2004 )</ref>.

According to Eq. (45) , the plastic part of the constitutive model is controlled by two parameters: q and œÑ 0 , both of which influence the value of the yield stress. Parameter q controls the dependence of the yield stress on the strain rate (for power law (45) , the dependence of the yield stress on the strain rate is linear in the log-log scale) and can be measured ( Section 3.5 ).

Maximum saturation of Li in Si is achieved for Li 4.4 Si <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">( McDowell, Lee, Harris et al., 2013 )</ref>, hence, with the approach taken in this paper, there are x = 4 . 4 ‚àí 3 . 75 = 0 . 65 free Li atoms (which are taken into account for the diffusion process) per each Si atom within the transformed material. Although the existence of bonded/unbonded atoms is not confirmed by experiments, such assumption is used in other papers on Si lithiation, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Drozdov (2014)</ref> .

The average approximate propagation speed of 15 nm/s was selected from the results presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Liu et al. (2011)</ref> . In the 1D case, the stationary diffusion problem (with c = c * boundary condition at the edge of the nanowire, which is in contact with the Li plate) can be solved analytically, and the following concentration at the reaction front x Œì can be found:</p><formula xml:id="formula_69">c | x = x Œì = D D + n * k * ( L ‚àí x Œì ) c * ,<label>(68)</label></formula><p>where D n * k * ( L ‚àí x Œì ) can be used.

From <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref> it can be seen that the characteristic speed of the diffusion of Li ions through the lithiated shell, which is proportional to D/R 0 = 2 ‚Ä¢ 10 3 nm/s, is much larger than the reaction rate, which is determined by the reaction rate parameter k * . In this case, the diffusion process reaches the stationary regime much faster than the time scale of the reaction rate.

To solve Eq. (72) with respect to Œª p, j at each integration point, Matlab's fzero function is used. However, since Eq. (72) is highly non-linear, the convergence with respect to the initial guess is improved by replacing the original equation with a linear equation in a region far from the root of the original equation, while keeping the function continuously differentiable everywhere. Within the numerical scheme, which is used in this paper, the position of the reaction front can only take the nodal values of R . The movement of the reaction front is modelled as the change of the position of the front by R each time step t . Since the spatial step is fixed, the time step becomes an additional unknown. Therefore, additional equation R = V t is required, the implicit form of which is used in the framework, i.e. V is calculated for the current position of the reaction front R i , while t is the time required for the reaction front to move from the previous position R i ‚àí1 to the current position R i . Since the reaction front can only be located at the node, each element can either belong to the core or to the shell. The material parameters of the transformed and the untransformed materials are used to calculate the element stresses corresponding to the shell and the core, respectively. The strain energies and the stretch ratios to the left and to the right of the reaction front are required to calculate V and are taken at the integration points of the elements, which share the reaction front node. The radial stress at the reaction front is calculated as an average of the radial stresses at the integration points of these elements.</p><p>Within this approach, the interface conditions (52) and (53) are fulfilled automatically.

The convergence rate, which is calculated as where ÀÜ r kN are nodal solutions on different grids that are taken at coinciding grid points, was found to be 1.028 (nodal average value) for N = 320 . In the presented numerical scheme, the convergence is limited by the first-order method that is used for the integration of the plastic flow and the velocity equations.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Stress and strain analysis</head><p>The distributions of the radial and the hoop Cauchy stresses along the radius of the particle are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3 a, b</ref> at different positions of the reaction front, i.e. at different stages of lithiation. The stresses in the core are homogeneous and hydrostatic. The dependence of the pressure in the core of the particle on the position of the reaction front is shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 4 a (positive pressure, p , means that the stress is compressive)</ref>. The highest magnitude of the hoop stress is achieved at the reaction front for all positions of the front, while the highest magnitude of the radial stress, is initially at the reaction front and shifts away from the front as the front moves towards the centre of the particle.</p><p>It can be seen that the stress in the core (as well as the radial stress at the reaction front) changes from tension to compression during the reaction front propagation. Moreover, the hoop stress in a layer adjacent to the edge of the particle changes from compression to tension. This can be explained as follows. When the chemical reaction starts, the reaction front is close to the outer edge of the particle, R Œì ‚âà R 0 , and the shell produces the tensile stress in the core. Indeed, if an expanded shell and an unexpanded core are considered separately, then, in order to satisfy the compatibility condition <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>. The dependence of the equivalent stress œÉ VM at the edge of the particle ( R = R 0 ) and dependence of pressure p in the core, which is also equal to the radial stress at the reaction front with the minus sign, on the position of the reaction front (a). The region where œÉ VM reaches the maximum value is magnified (b). The dependence of the jump of the radial stretch ratio at the reaction front ( R = R Œì ), which is reduced by the volumetric expansion factor of the transformed material, and the dependence of the current particle radius r ( R 0 ), which is normalised by R 0 , on the position of the reaction front (c).</p><p>at the reaction front, the inner surface of the shell has to be moved towards the centre of the particle, while the outer surface of the core has to be moved away from the centre. These deformations produce the tensile radial stress. However, due to the large magnitude of the stresses, the shell undergoes plastic deformation, which results in a stress relaxation in the shell behind the reaction front and decreases the tensile stress in the core. As the reaction front moves, another portion of the material undergoes the chemical transformation and, thus, the volumetric expansion. This may be viewed as a volumetric expansion of a thin layer near the reaction front. This expansion produces the radial compressive stress, which is superposed with the "previous" radial stress. As a result, starting from some position of the reaction front, the radial stress at the reaction front (as well as in the core) becomes compressive <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">( Fig. 3 a)</ref>, while hoop stress in a layer adjacent to the edge of the particle becomes tensile <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">( Fig. 3 b)</ref>.</p><p>The above reasoning is also confirmed by the distributions of the radial plastic strain, Œµ p = ln Œª p , along the radius of the particle at various positions of the reaction front <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">( Fig. 3 c)</ref>. The radial plastic strain rapidly decreases along the radial coordinate. The radial plastic strain at the edge of the particle ( R = R 0 ) decreases as the reaction front moves towards the centre of the particle. This happens due to the build up of the tensile hoop stress that drives the increase of the hoop plastic strain, which is ‚àí0 . 5 ln Œª p , and, thus, the decrease of the radial plastic strain.</p><p>The radial plastic strain, Œµ p , reaches the maximum value in the region close the reaction front, as seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3 c;</ref> however, the magnification shows that there is a small plateau next to the reaction front <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">( Fig. 3 d)</ref>. This plateau is the result of the change of œÉ * s , which is governing the plastic flow according to Eq. (61) , from a positive value of 0.54 GPa at the reaction front to a negative value of ‚àí0 . 43 GPa at the distance of 0.007 R 0 from the reaction front <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">( Fig. 3 e)</ref>.</p><p>Stress œÉ * s reaches the maximum positive value at the reaction front and produces large plastic deformation, while the maximum negative œÉ * s (compressive stress) in the rest of the shell leads to the decreasing Œµ p in time, which is seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3</ref> c. It should be noted that, as discussed above, Œµ p always decreases for a fixed radial coordinate due to the compressive stress œÉ * s . The analysis of stress œÉ * s shows that the behaviour of the model is indeed very similar to an elasto-plastic model with hardening, i.e. where the plasticity is modelled by the "slider" element. As seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3</ref> e, stress œÉ * s has almost constant value of ‚àí0 . 43 GPa within nearly entire shell, which results in the unlocking of the viscous element, i.e. only hardening spring is active, while the other spring is locked. In the region close to the reaction front, the absolute value of stress œÉ * s is not large enough and the viscous element is locked, i.e. both springs are unlocked and work in parallel. According to the selected power law, which is given by Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_58">61</ref>, intermediate values of œÉ * s are not large enough to generate a plastic flow within the modelling time scale (since the exponent in the power law, q + , is relatively large); therefore, the plastic deformation within the small region behind the reaction front (region of the intermediate values of œÉ * s ) is frozen. Obviously, very similar behaviour will also be observed, if the ideal plastic element (with rate-dependent yield stress) is used instead of the non-linear viscous element.</p><p>The equivalent stress œÉ VM = (1 . 5 œÉ d : œÉ d ) 1 / 2 at the edge of the particle is plotted in <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref> a as a function of the position of the reaction front. It can be seen that when the position of the reaction front is close to 0.73 R 0 , the equivalent stress is close to zero. The profile of the equivalent stress is non-monotonic due to the change of the sign of the hoop stress, while the equivalent stress is always non-negative. As discussed above, there is a small region behind the reaction front with the frozen plastic deformation. This creates the change in the slope of œÉ VM at the edge of the particle, as illustrated in <ref type="figure">Fig. 4 b,</ref> as the end of the frozen plastic deformation zone crosses the boundary of the domain.</p><p>The results regarding the total radial strain are not shown in figures; however it is useful to note that the maximum value of the total radial strain in the shell is achieved at the reaction front. This value is always positive since it includes the transformation-induced volumetric expansion. When the position of the reaction front approaches the centre of the particle, the total radial strain is almost constant along the radius, apart from the region neighbouring the reaction front where it peaks.</p><p>Another quantity that defines the behaviour of the system is the jump of the radial stretch ratio at the reaction front,</p><formula xml:id="formula_76">Œª r = d r/ d R .</formula><p>It corresponds to the radial component of the deformation gradient jump, F R , which is the only non-  zero component of F . The evolution of this quantity is shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref> c. The jump of the stretch ratio changes nonmonotonically with R Œì , with the initial increase and the subsequent decrease. This quantity highly influences the velocity of the reaction front, as discussed below. The relative size of the particle, r / R 0 at R = R 0 , monotonically increases up to a value that is close to the expansion ratio g .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Reaction front kinetics</head><p>The velocity of the reaction front as a function of the position of the front is plotted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 5</ref> a for various values of the chemical energy parameter, Œ≥ . The velocity profile is non-monotonic, which results from the interplay between various terms of the chemical affinity (the details are provided in Section 4.3 ).</p><p>The initial velocity of the reaction front (at R Œì = R 0 ) decreases with the decrease of Œ≥ , and the velocity is close to zero for Œ≥ = 4 J/mm 3 . Therefore, when Œ≥ is below a certain threshold value, which can be referred to as a critical value, Œ≥ * , the chemical reaction cannot start at the surface of the particle. This is a result of internal stresses that would be produced by the transformation strain if the reaction started, and this was also shown analytically for the case of elastic small strains <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">( Freidin, Morozov et al., 2016 )</ref>. It should be emphasised that the threshold effect is absent if the contribution of stresses to the chemical affinity is neglected, i.e. in this case, the reaction proceeds at any Œ≥ &gt; 0. The thickness of the shell (the transformed material) depending on time is plotted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 6</ref> for various Œ≥ .</p><p>Initially, the velocity increases as the reaction front propagates, then varies slowly, and afterwards the velocity starts to decrease and practically drops to zero, which means the blocking of the reaction. This velocity drop does not happen if stresses are neglected in the expression for the chemical affinity (curves marked with "no stresses in A NN "). Thus, the blocking effect originates from the competition between the mechanical and the chemical parts of the affinity tensor, and it can be seen that the reaction retardation starts earlier if the input of the chemical energy, Œ≥ , decreases.</p><p>The blocking effect can be also explained in terms of the equilibrium concentration of the diffusive constituent. The front can propagate only if c eq &lt; c * , according to Eq. (63) . The equilibrium concentration, in turn, depends on stresses and strains according to Eq. (64) , while stresses and strains depend on the front position. The direct reaction cannot proceed if c eq approaches c * as the reaction front approaches a certain position. As this happens, the concentration of the diffusive component in the shell also approaches c * .</p><p>These results qualitatively correspond to the experimental evidence of the influence of stresses on the kinetics of the reaction between Li and Si. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">In van Havenbergh et al. (2016)</ref> , various coatings were applied to Si particles. Different coatings provided different mechanical constrains for the Si particle and thereby led to different internal stresses. The final size of the remaining untransformed Si core varied depending on the coating. Thus, the connection between stresses and the reaction arrest was experimentally observed. Moreover, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Obrovac and Krause (2007)</ref> , it was also observed that the Si core is maintained during charge/discharge cycling. According to the model proposed in this paper, at Œ≥ = 5 J/mm 3 , the lithiation time from R Œì = R 0 to R Œì = 0 . 125 R 0 is t = 95 . 51 s. This is quantitatively comparable to the results reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">McDowell, Lee, Harris et al. (2013)</ref> , where particles of radius 285 nm underwent full lithiation in 129 s.</p><p>As seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 5</ref> , the dependence of V changes from concave to convex when the reaction is close to being blocked. This is an indication that the reaction locking is approached asymptotically. It should be noted that, since the transformed material is viscoelastic, the stresses undergo the relaxation process, which can lead to unblocking of the reaction. However, since the material has a highly non-linear viscosity resulting in the elasto-plastic behaviour of the material, the stress relaxation process may require very large time scales and cannot be observed within the time scales of the simulations performed in this paper. It should be noted that if the transformed material demonstrates linear viscosity, the relaxation time becomes comparable to the chemical reaction time scale and the stress relaxation near the reaction front plays a significant role.</p><p>The influence of the internal stresses decreases with the increase of Œ≥ , although the reaction blocking effect is still present at the end of the transformation. For example, for Œ≥ = 7 J/mm 3 , the internal stresses do not affect the reaction rate in the wide range of the reaction front positions. The curve for the dependence of the reaction front velocity on the front position practically coincides with the curve plotted without taking the stresses into account until the particle is almost completely transformed. Term exp ‚àíA NN /R g T in Eq. (10) becomes small at large Œ≥ , and the reaction front velocity becomes almost proportional to the concentration, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">( Figs. 5 a, b)</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_77">V ‚âà ( n ‚àí M ‚àí /œÅ ‚àí ) k * c</formula><p>From the numerical point of view, when the reaction front velocity drops, longer time steps t are required for moving the reaction front by the constant spatial step R , as is done in the numerical procedure. In this case, the numerical method, which is used in this paper, looses accuracy due to a coarse discretisation of the equations in time. The case of small reaction front velocities should be studied separately using the finite element technique with a non-conforming mesh with respect to the reaction front. In this paper, the simulations were terminated when V reached small values, as explained in Section 3.6 .</p><p>The influence of the surface mass transfer coefficient, Œ±, on the velocity profile is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 5</ref> c. From Eq. (63) , it can be seen that the decrease of parameter Œ± reduces the reaction front velocity. This is an expected result, since the front velocity should decrease when the diffusive delivery of the constituent B * is delayed. It can also be seen that Œ± affects the front velocity stronger when Œæ 1, i.e. at the initial stage of the transformation. When Œæ ‚Üí 1, the distance between the outer surface and the reaction front increases and, therefore, the relative role of the diffusion coefficient D increases, denominator in Eq. (63) becomes dominated by Œæ / D 0 . These qualitative observations are fully confirmed by the dependencies in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 5</ref> c.</p><p>One of the ways of optimising the capacity of lithium-ion batteries is using small Si particles. The dependence of the reaction front velocity on the front position, for which the initial particle radius, R 0 , was varied, is presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 5</ref> d. From Eq. (63) , it can be seen that the variation of the particle radius is mathematically equivalent to the variation of the diffusion coefficient, as they both enter the equation for the velocity only via parameter D 0 . It can be seen that the variation of R 0 in the range of 50-50 0 0 nm <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">( Fig. 5 d)</ref> practically does not affect the reaction front velocity, V , but, therefore, strongly affects the relative lithiation rate, V / R 0 , which increases with the decrease of R 0 . Note that in the case of nano-size particles, the surface tension, which is not considered in the paper, may produce additional input into the stresses.</p></div>

In the case of spherical symmetry, this term is given by Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_64">65</ref>, where r / R is close to 1 at the reaction front due to small volumetric expansion of the core (which is the result of a relatively large bulk modulus of the untransformed material). Therefore, P ‚àí : F is mainly determined by the product of the pressure in the core with the minus sign and the jump in the radial stretch ratio, Œª r , which are illustrated in <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref> . The strain energy terms, W ‚àí and W + , at the reaction front, are varying only slightly with the position of the front and their contribution to A NN remains approximately constant.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p>In this paper, the problem of stress-affected two-phase lithiation kinetics in Si particles was considered. A coupled chemo-mechanical model was proposed by combining for the first time the concept of the chemical affinity tensor with a finite-strain non-linear viscoelastic model. In the proposed model, the diffusion flux does not depend on the stresses and the concentration of the diffusive constituent does not enter the mechanical constitutive model. However, from the mathematical point of view, viscoelastic strains lead to the total stress-diffusion-reaction coupling even in the case of spherical symmetry, as opposed to the elastic case. The coupled problem was solved using the finite element approach to predict propagation of the reaction front and the stress-strain state during a two-phase lithiation of the spherical Si particle.</p><p>The stress distribution within the particle and the evolution of stresses during the reaction front propagation were studied in detail. Similar to the elastic case, the radial and the hoop stress in the transformed material are tensile and compressive, respectively, at the initial stage of lithiation. However, due to the non-linear viscosity of the lithiated Si, which leads to the behaviour similar to plasticity, the hoop stress in the outer region of the transformed material becomes tensile at later stages of lithiation.</p><p>The influence of mechanical stresses on the kinetics of the reaction front was shown. At certain values of the chemical energy parameter, the model captured the reaction blocking effect, which had been observed experimentally. It was also shown that the relative lithiation rate increases with the decrease of the particle radius.</p><p>The results of the paper may be helpful to design efficient Si particle-based anodes in future Li-ion batteries.

When c-Si reacts with Li, at first amorphous Li 3.75 Si (a-Li 3.75 Si) is formed, which at room temperature crystallises into Li 15 Si 4 that is the highest achievable capacity at ambient temperature<ref type="bibr" target="#b48">( Obrovac &amp; Krause, 2007 )</ref>. Also, the spherical symmetry assumption cannot be used when the c-Si particle is modelled, since the material is anisotropic.</note>
